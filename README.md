# React Resume - Alpha

## How to use this:

1. You can download the pdf version of my [Frontend Developer Resume here](https://github.com/tgrrr/resume/raw/master/resume.pdf)

2. Clicking the job title of each job will take you to a more detailed version online

Or, you can go straight to the [online resume directly](http://resume.botbotdot.com)

For each job, you can click on the link and learn more about the job.

## Why did I build this?
- **To simplify my resume** - Single page resume's are great, and I found myself wanting to provide more details if people asked.
- **Drill down for more detail** - Interviewers who want more details can click on each job, and see a more detailed CV with all of the details they might seek
- _But_ We still need to submit pdfs documents for jobs
- **Save time** for everyone - because we put so many filters in between a job seeker and the decision maker:

  - Job seeker
  - Recruiter (potentially)
  - Automated filter
  - Human Resources
  - Rounds of tests
  - Interviewer(s)
  - Decision Maker

## Built with:
- React.js
- ES6 Javascript ECMA6
- CSS Modules
- Serverless
- Static CMS - [Contentful](http://contentful.com)
- Design [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/)
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Why static?

- [1.4 second initial load]
- 7 initial requests
- sub .1 second initial response
- data syncs locally for PWA's and **faster** secondary load times

[1.4 second initial load]: https://tools.keycdn.com/speed?h=5ae2bf0671bf270b7472c345

## Benefits for:

#### Job hunters

It's time consuming for candidates to:
  - Update their resume
  - Customise a resume for each position
- We don't know who is reading it, so can either provide them with too much or too little details

#### Interviewer

- **Find the right person** Great job hunters are too busy working on great projects, so don't apply.
It's time consuming for interviewers to:
- **More detail in less time** - It takes forever to read through a 6 page resume. This way they can see a short teaser resume, and get more detail if necessary.
- **Roadmap:** skip the resume all together

## Roadmap
- **Data driven** - Provides a heatmap so we can see what interviewers care about, to provide a data driven way to automatically improve resumes
- Add UI design previews
- Quickly tailor resumes - Job seekers select the relevant entries, and then click to generate a unique PDF and website for each job they're applying for
- **tl;dr:** Automate matching the right person with a job
- Import job history from Linkedin, StackOverflow, standardised coding tests, etc.
- Coach people through interviews
